In this first week, we’ll review the course syllabus and discover the various concepts and objectives to be mastered in weeks to come. You’ll be introduced to inference methods and some of the research questions we’ll discuss in the course, as well as an overall framework for making decisions using data, considerations for how you make those decisions, and evaluating errors that you may have made. On the Python side, we’ll review some high level concepts from the first course in this series, Python’s statistics landscape, and walk through intermediate level Python concepts. All of the course information on grading, prerequisites, and expectations are on the course syllabus and you can find more information on our Course Resources page.
