# ## Creating confidence intervals in python
# In this assessment, you will look at data from a study on toddler sleep habits. 
# 
# The confidence intervals you create and the questions you answer in this Jupyter notebook will be used to answer questions in the following graded assignment.

# Your goal is to analyse data which is the result of a study that examined
# differences in a number of sleep variables between napping and non-napping toddlers. Some of these
# sleep variables included: Bedtime (lights-off time in decimalized time), Night Sleep Onset Time (in
# decimalized time), Wake Time (sleep end time in decimalized time), Night Sleep Duration (interval
# between sleep onset and sleep end in minutes), and Total 24-Hour Sleep Duration (in minutes). Note:
# [Decimalized time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decimal_time) is the representation of the time of day using units which are decimally related.   
# 
# 
# The 20 study participants were healthy, normally developing toddlers with no sleep or behavioral
# problems. These children were categorized as napping or non-napping based upon parental report of
# childrenâ€™s habitual sleep patterns. Researchers then verified napping status with data from actigraphy (a
# non-invasive method of monitoring human rest/activity cycles by wearing of a sensor on the wrist) and
# sleep diaries during the 5 days before the study assessments were made.
# 
# 
# You are specifically interested in the results for the Bedtime, Night Sleep Duration, and Total 24-
# Hour Sleep Duration.

df


# **Question**: What variable is used in the column 'napping' to indicate a toddler takes a nap?
# 
# 
# **Question**: What is the sample size $n$?

# ## Hypothesis testing
# We will look at two hypothesis test, each with $\alpha = .025$:  
# 
# 
# 1. Is the average bedtime for toddlers who nap later than the average bedtime for toddlers who don't nap?
# 
# 
# $$H_0: \mu_{nap}=\mu_{no\ nap}, \ H_a:\mu_{nap}>\mu_{no\ nap}$$
# Or equivalently:
# $$H_0: \mu_{nap}-\mu_{no\ nap}=0, \ H_a:\mu_{nap}-\mu_{no\ nap}>0$$
# 
# 
# 2. The average 24 h sleep duration (in minutes) for napping toddlers is different from toddlers who don't nap.
# 
# 
# $$H_0: \mu_{nap}=\mu_{no\ nap}, \ H_a:\mu_{nap}\neq\mu_{no\ nap}$$
# Or equivalenty:
# $$H_0: \mu_{nap}-\mu_{no\ nap}=0, \ H_a:\mu_{nap}-\mu_{no\ nap} \neq 0$$
# 
# Aside: This $\alpha$ level is equivalent to $\alpha = .05$ and then applying the [Bonferonni correction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bonferroni_correction).

# Before any analysis, we will convert 'night bedtime' into decimalized time. 

# In[4]:


# Convert 'night bedtime' into decimalized time
df.loc[:,'night bedtime'] = np.floor(df['night bedtime'])*60 + np.round(df['night bedtime']%1,2 )*100


# Now, isolate the column 'night bedtime' for those who nap into a new variable, and those who didn't nap into another new variable. 

# In[19]:


nap_bedtime = df.loc[df['napping'] == 1,'night bedtime']


# In[20]:


no_nap_bedtime = df.loc[df['napping'] == 0,'night bedtime']


# Now find the sample mean bedtime for nap and no_nap.

# In[21]:


nap_mean_bedtime = np.mean(nap_bedtime)


# In[22]:


no_nap_mean_bedtime = np.mean(no_nap_bedtime)


# In[23]:


dif = nap_mean_bedtime - no_nap_mean_bedtime
dif


# **Question**: What is the sample difference of mean bedtime for nappers minus no nappers?

# Now find the sample standard deviation for $X_{nap}$ and $X_{no\ nap}$.

# In[29]:


nap_s_bedtime = statistics.stdev(nap_bedtime)
nap_s_bedtime


# In[30]:


no_nap_s_bedtime = np.std(no_nap_bedtime)
no_nap_s_bedtime


# **Question**: What is the s.e.$(\bar{X}_{nap} - \bar{X}_{no\ nap})$?
# 
# We expect the variance in sleep time for toddlers who nap and toddlers who don't nap to be the same. So we use a pooled standard error.
# 
# Calculate the pooled standard error of $\bar{X}_{nap} - \bar{X}_{no\ nap}$ using the formula below.
# 
# $s.e.(\bar{X}_{nap} - \bar{X}_{no\ nap}) = \sqrt{\frac{(n_1-1)s_1^2 + (n_2-1)s_2^2}{n_1+n_2-2}(\frac{1}{n_1}+\frac{1}{n_2})}$

# In[32]:


pooled_se = nap_s_bedtime - no_nap_s_bedtime

# **Question**: Given our sample size of $n$, how many degrees of freedom ($df$) are there for the associated $t$ distribution?

# Now calculate the $t$-test statistic for our first hypothesis test using  
# * pooled s.e.($\bar{X}_{nap} - \bar{X}_{no\ nap}$)  
# * $\bar{X}_{nap} - \bar{X}_{no\ nap}$  
# * $\mu_{0,\ nap} - \mu_{0,\ no\ nap}=0$, the population difference in means under the null hypothesis

from scipy import stats

stats.ttest_ind(nap_bedtime,no_nap_bedtime)


# **Question**: What is the p-value for the first hypothesis test?

# To find the p-value, we can use the function:
# ```
# t.cdf(y, df)
# ```
# Which for $X \sim t(df)$ returns $P(X \leq y)$.
# 
# Because of the symmetry of the $t$ distrubution, we have that 
# ```
# 1-t.cdf(y, df)
# ```
# returns $P(X > y)$
# 
# The function t.cdf(y, df) will give you the same value as finding the one-tailed probability of y on a t-table with the specified degrees of freedom.
# 
# Use the function t.cdf(y, df) to find the p-value for the first hypothesis test.

# In[37]:


t.cdf(nap_s_bedtime, 19)


# **Question**: What are the t-statistic and p-value for the second hypothesis test?
# 
# Calculate the $t$ test statistics and corresponding p-value using the scipy function scipy.stats.ttest_ind(a, b, equal_var=True) and check with your answer. 
# 
# **Question**: Does scipy.stats.ttest_ind return values for a one-sided or two-sided test?
# 
# **Question**: Can you think of a way to recover the results you got using 1-t.cdf from the p-value given by scipy.stats.ttest_ind?
# 
# Use the scipy function scipy.stats.ttest_ind(a, b, equal_var=True) to find the $t$ test statistic and corresponding p-value for the second hypothesis test.
