In this second week, we will learn about estimating population parameters via confidence intervals. You will be introduced to five different types of population parameters, assumptions needed to calculate a confidence interval for each of these five parameters, and how to calculate confidence intervals. Quizzes will appear throughout the week to test your understanding. In addition, youâ€™ll learn how to create confidence intervals in Python.
